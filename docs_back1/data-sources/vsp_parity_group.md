# hitachi_vsp_parity_group (Data Source)

The following request obtains information about all parity groups.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "hitachi_vsp_parity_group" "myparitygroup" {
  serial = 30078
  #parity_group_ids = ["1-2","1-3"]
}

output "myparitygroup" {
  value = data.hitachi_vsp_parity_group.myparitygroup
}
```
